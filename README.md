## Overview

During this hackathon, we collaborated as a team to build three engaging games that capture the Halloween spirit. All games are designed using **React** and **Next.js** to ensure a modern and interactive user experience. Get ready to test your skills and have some fun with our Halloween-inspired creations!

### Games Created

1. **Higher or Lower**
   - A card guessing game where players try to predict whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card.

2. **Pong**
   - A classic Pong game with a chilling twist! 
3. **Memory Game**
   - Test your memory with our Halloween-themed memory game. Flip the cards to find matching pairs.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces and managing state.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing capabilities.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating spooky aesthetics for each game.

A big thank you to the School of Code and Good Growth for hosting this hackathon and to our mentors for their support.

We hope you enjoy playing our games as much as we enjoyed creating them. Happy Halloween! ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»
